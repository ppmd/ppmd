Introduction
============


Performance Portable Molecular Dynamics (PPMD) is a portable high level framework to create high performance Molecular Dynamics codes. The principle idea is that a simulation consists of sets of particles and most operations on these particles can be described using either a loop over all particles or a loop over particle pairs and applying some operation.
